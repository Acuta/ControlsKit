## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, open the workspace and run `ControlsKitExample`.

## Requirements

iOS 8.0

## Description

This is a list of components that have been developped over the course of multiple years, and have been used in a dozen of projects so far. They aim to either be a drop-in replacement for existing controls with more customizations, or provide additional features on top of existing controls.

### NibView

Allows to use Interface Builder to create the layout of a view inside a xib file, which can be then be loaded like any views.

### PageControl

![PageControl](README_Files/PageControl-Example.gif)

Re-implemented from scratch and **fully customizable**, our Page Control allows to do in just a few lines what would take hundreds if subclassing the native one (not to mention the dirty overrides usually implied).

- Specify your **custom active/inactive dot images** (with possibly most-left and most-right ones different)
- Specify **spacing** between dots (animatable)
- Enjoy all other possibilities the native Page Control provides via the **very same API**

### PlaceholderTextView

A subclass of `UITextView` which provides a placeholder text.

### Switch

![Switch](README_Files/Switch-Example.gif)

The native **UISwitch** often forces developers to implement their own custom subclass because of its **limitations**. Our Switch subclass should address the most common ones:

- Inability to set a **background off color** to replace the native grey one

Addition of new `offTintColor` property (counterpart of native `onTintColor` property)

- Unreliable logic when **setting or removing** `onImage` and `offImage` with current color

Refined logic so `onImage` takes precedence over `onTintColor` if set: the image is seen, the on tint color is not seen. If `onImage` is nil, the `onTintColor` is shown. The same logic applies to `offTintColor` and all combinations are totally customizable, reliably, at all times.

## Installation

### Via CocoaPods

ControlsKit is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ControlsKit', '~> 1.0'
```

By default, the Swift version of the library is fetched. If you want to just use the Objective-C version, just add the following line instead in your Podfile: 

```ruby
pod 'ControlsKit/ObjC', '~> 1.0'
```

Likewise, you might not want to pull all controls at once if you're just using one. So for example, if you wanted to just use the `PlaceholderTextView` in your project, just add the following:

```ruby
pod 'ControlsKit/PlaceholderTextView/Swift', '~> 1.0'
```

(You can also replace `Swift` by `ObjC` should you want to use the Objective-C version)

### Via Carthage

ControlsKit is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install it, simply add the following line to your Cartfile:

```
github "Acuta/ControlsKit" ~> 1.0
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, just add `ControlsKit.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and make sure you've included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.
