/**
 *  This UISwitch subclass defines or redifines useful UI properties for your switches:
 *
 *   - onTintColor: color of the background when the switch is On. If set to nil, the default color (green) will be applied.
 *   - offTintColor: color of the background when the switch is Off. If set to nil, the default color (clearColor) will be applied.
 *
 *   - onImage: image in the background when the switch is On. If "onTintColor" is defined, the image will override the color (color won't be seen). If set to nil, the previous image will be deleted and the onTintColor will be seen instead.
 *   - offImage: image in the background when the switch is Off. if "offTintColor" is defined, the image will override the color (color won't be seen). If set to nil, the previous image will be deleted and the offTintColor will be seen instead.
